# File manager for Laravel

This plugin help to manage your files on BBDD with the framework Laravel, attaching a model with one or more files.  
This plugin organizes all the information in the database and saves the file on the platform that we have indicated. It also handles the deletion and copying of files. To save files is based on the control and management of Laravel files through the configuration of its disks, so you can easily save your files on the local server, amazon s3, ftp etc.

## Installation

This requires Laravel 5.8 or highter and Php 5.6 or highter.

1) In order to install File manager, just run in terminal: 

```json
composer require fboseca/files_manager
```
2) Open your `config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` array:

```php
\Fboseca\Filesmanager\FilesManagerServiceProvider::class,
```  

3) Run the command below to publish the package config file `config/filemanager.php`:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish
```
4) Now we must create the table for files. The default name of the table is **files_manager** but if you want to change the name of the table you can do it in `config/filemanager.php` on the key ***table_file***. 
So when you choose the name run the command below:
```shell
php artisan migrate
```
5) File manager use a laravel storage link for public files saved in you own host, so run the command below:
```php
php artisan storage:link
```
## Configuration
Copy the property values below in the `config/filesystems.php`.  File manager use the Laravel`s disks for save files and these values will be used for get information for  save it. 

    'temp' => [  
       'driver' => 'local',  
      'root' => storage_path('app/temp'),  
      'visibility' => 'private',  
    ],
    'private' => [  
       'driver' => 'local',  
      'root' => storage_path('app/private'),  
      'url' => config('filemanager.symbolic_link_private'),  
      'visibility' => 'private',  
    ],  
      
    'public' => [  
       'driver' => 'local',  
      'root' => storage_path('app/public'),  
      'url' => env('APP_URL') . '/storage',  
      'visibility' => 'public',  
    ],
    's3' => [  
       'driver' => 's3',  
      'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),  
      'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),  
      'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'),  
      'bucket' => env('AWS_BUCKET'),  
      'url' => env('AWS_URL'),  
      'visibility' => 'public',  
    ],
> All disk must have a **visibility** field that can be *public* or
> *private*.

You can modify any disk and add all what you want.

| Field | Description|
|--|--|
| root | Folder when the files will be saved  |
| url | Url for get the files, this url is used when we use the attributte *src*  explained below |
| visibility | Can be *public* or *private* and all files saved using this disk will be treated as public or private  |
| driver | Can be all options that Laravel offers (local, s3, ftp, dropbox)  |

### Temporal disk
Is important have a temporary disk and you should not remove the temporary disk from the configuration. If you change the name of temporary disk (**not recommended**) you must change the name in `config/filemanager.php` in the key *disk_temp*.

### Public disk
The local public disk by default  **should not be modified.** If you want add other public disk you can do it adding other disk. 

> Remember that all public files will be save under **storage_path('app/public/your-custom-folder').**

    //disk by default
    'public' => [  
	      'driver' => 'local',  
	      'root' => storage_path('app/public'),  
	      'url' => env('APP_URL') . '/storage',  
	      'visibility' => 'public',  
    ],
    //new disk created
    'uploads' => [  
	      'driver' => 'local',  
	      'root' => storage_path('app/public/uploads'),  
	      'url' => env('APP_URL') . '/storage/uploads',  
	      'visibility' => 'public',  
    ],

> Remember that FileManager use the symbolic link of Laravel for return
> the path when the file is hosted so it`s very important to indicate
> the url field inside the disk configuration

### Private disk
Private disk is used for files that you don't want to be accessible from the public path. 
#### Local files
For security reasons, when we want to access the download or viewing path of a private file, FileManager will encrypt the file id and add it to the path. The route by default is :

> private/file/id-encrypt-for-file

To get the url of a private file we use the forceSrc attribute as explained below in the documentation [Show image files on html](#show-image-files-on-html).
If you want **to change the default route** you can do it in `routes/web.php`  or you route file adding:

    Route::get('you/route/{has}', function ($has) {  
       return \Redirect::route('file.manager.private', $has);  
    })->name('custom.files');

The `has` parameter it is important to collect the encrypted id of the file and and it must be the last parameter of the created route. After you change the default route you must config the file `config/filemanager.php`: 

    "symbolic_link_private" => "custom.files",  
    "url_link_private_files" => "you/route/", 
Note that in the **symbolic link private** you must put the name of your custom route and in the **url link private files** you must put the route without the `has` parameter. 
So the route finally will be:
> you/route/id-encrypt-for-file

The folder by default when files will be saved is `app/private` but you can change the folder when you want modifying the root key of the private disk in `config/filesystem.php`

    'private' => [  
    	  'driver' => 'local',  
    	  'root' => storage_path('app/you/custom/folder'),  
    	  'url' => config('filemanager.symbolic_link_private'),  
    	  'visibility' => 'private',  
    ],

> Is important not to change the line `'url' =>
> config('filemanager.symbolic_link_private'),` of the configuration of
> the disk.
#### External files
for other drivers like s3 or ftp it is not necessary to configure any path, you just need to provide the path in the url key of the disk configuration.

    's3' => [  
      'url' => env('AWS_URL'),  
    ],

### Other config
The options that you have for config this plugin are:
| Field | Description|Default
|--|--|--|
| folder_default | The folder when the files will be save under the disk  |files
| disk_default | Disk by default |public
| extension_default | If file donÂ´t has a extension, this will be applied|txt
| extensions | List by extension for indicates how file manager must catalog a file by her extension |

### File extensions
When we save a file this will be saved with a type that we will indicate in the configuration inside the extensions key. This file configuration is `config/filemanager.php`. By default all files with image extensions are treated as *img* type, as shown in the example below, but you can modify it by the type you want. 

    "extensions" => [  
          "bmp" => "img",  
          "gif" => "img",  
          "jpeg" => "img",  
          "jpg" => "img",  
          "png" => "img",  
          "tiff" => "img",

If the file extension is not appear in the list, FileManager will use the default key that is given by *:

    "extensions" => [
	    "*" => "file"
In this case a file with extension *text/css* will be treated like *file* type. Do not remove the `*` value from the extensions`s configuration.

> If the original file does not have an extension FileManager will apply
> the default file extension, this can be configured in
> **extension_default** key that by default is *txt*.

This is useful for find any type of files as discussed below.

## Usage
The first action we must to do is attach in the model that we want you to have a file log the trait **HasFiles**.  You can choose any model for attach files, the only thing you have to do is put the trait into a model.

    class User extends Authenticatable {  
       use Notifiable, HasFiles;
       .....
    }
Now the model *User* can attach files to self.

### Add a file
For attach a file to a model use the method **addFile** passing the file that you want to save. Any file that you add, ***never going to be overwrite***, it is a security system to prevent files from being replaced. Each file will be attached with a single model. 
For attach a file to model follow the next steps:
In you Html:

    <input type="file"  name="file">

In you Laravel`s Controller

    $user = User::find(1);
    $user->addFile( $request->file('file'));

Automatically FileManager create a unique random name and save the file within the database and on the platform and folder indicated in the disk configuration. 
If we have not indicated any disk or folder to our model, it will take the default configuration of the file `config/filemanager.php`.

> In case that the name exists in the disk and folder, FileManager
> automatically change de name to `name_(1).extension` to make sure the
> file will not be overwritten.

This method accept three parameters.
|Parameter| Description | Default |
|--|--|--|
| file | The file uploaded |
| group | The group to which the file belongs. (*optional*)|void 
| name | The name of file without extension. (*optional*)|random string
| description |  A description for a file (*optional*)|void 

     $user->addFile( 
	     $request->file('file'),
	     "gallery",
	     "myNameFile",
	     "A description for a file"
     );
Note that FileManager will apply the correct extension for a file.

### Logo
FileManager provide a method for save a logo of a model. This is a special method and only accept one image, so if we pass a image to save it as a logo, the last image will be deleted. To save a image like a logo we use the method **setLogo**.

    $user->setLogo( $request->file('file') );

Parameters of the method **setLogo**:
|Parameter| Description | Default |
|--|--|--|
| file | The file uploaded |
| name | The name of file without extension. (*optional*)|random string
| description |  A description for a file (*optional*)|void 

For get a instance of logo use the attribute **logo**, that return a FileManager model.

    $user->logo;
    
### Get a files
We can access to the files of a model in many ways. The best form is calling the relationships **files**. Files return a collection of the FileManager class. 

    $user->files

If you want get only the image files you can invoke the relationships **images**.

    @foreach ($user->images as $file )  
      <img src="{{$file->src}}"  width="100"/>  
    @endforeach

By default only images is configured for get a type of file of the model, but if you want add more type of relationship see the [Create a model for a kind of file](#create-a-model-for-a-kind-of-file).

### Method exists
You can check if a file exist in the folder and disk of model with method **exists**:

    $user->exists("name-of-file-with-extension");
    
### Change disk and folder

The disk and folder by default are configured in `config/filemanager.php`  and affect to all models by default.

#### For this model
If you want change a folder o a disk for a specific model you can do it overwriting the method **fileCustomVariables** into the model.  

    class User extends Authenticatable {  
	   use Notifiable, HasFiles;
	   
	    public function fileCustomVariables() {  
	      $this->FILE_FOLDER_DEFAULT = "/users/$this->id/documents";  
	      $this->FILE_DISK_DEFAULT = 's3';  
	    }
    }
In this case when a file is attached to a User model it will be saved in the disk *s3* in the folder */user/id-of-user/documents*. This will happen with all files attached to model. 

#### For only once
If we want change the disk or folder only once, we can use the method *folder* and *disk*:

    //disk and folder default for file`s config or model`s config
    $user->addFile( $request->file('file'));
    
    //now we change the disk and folder
    $user->disk('s3')  
       ->folder("/users/$user->id/documents")  
       ->addFile( $request->file('file')  ); 
When we use the method disk and folder, all files attached after will be saved in the folder an disk specified.

### Get folder and disk
If you want to know what is the actual disk and folder only call this methods:

    $user->getFolder(); //files
    $user->getDisk(); //public
    $user->disk('s3')->folder("/users/$user->id/documents");
    $user->getFolder(); // users/1/documents
    $user->getDisk(); // s3
    
### Save file from source or content
We can save a file from a specific path or if we have a content from file.

    $user->addFileFromSource( storage_path('app/public/temporal1.jpg') );
    $user->addFileFromContent( $contentForAFile, $extension );
When we add a file by her content is necessary indicate the extension of file. 
Both methods have parameters for give a *group*, *name* and *description* in the same orden like method [addFile](#add-a-file).

### Scopes 
We can filter of files using scopes of the relations:

    $user->files()->ofGroup('gallery')->get();
    $user->files()->ofNotGroup('gallery')->get();
    $user->files()->ofType('img')->get();
    $user->files()->ofNotType('img')->get();


### Create a model for a kind of file
Sometimes we can have a custom FileManager from a kind of file for anything. This plugin allow to create you own custom FileManager`s model: 

 1. Creating a new class

Create a class that extends of `Fboseca\Filesmanager\FileManager`, select the type of file that you want to attach to this model and **apply the global scoped TypeFileScope.**

    use Fboseca\Filesmanager\Models\FileManager;  
    use Fboseca\Filesmanager\scopes\TypeFileScope;    
    
    class Docs extends FileManager {  
      
     public $type_file = 'word';  
     
     protected static function boot() {  
          parent::boot();  
	      static::addGlobalScope(new TypeFileScope());  
      }  
    }
In this case the class *Doc* is for files that we consider word type. Remember that the type of the files is configured in `config/filemanager.php`, to see how go [File extensions](#file-extensions).

    "extensions" => [  
    .....
      "doc" => "word",  
      "docx" => "word",
      ......
All files with extension doc or docx are considered word types.

 2. Usage

When we have already created the model we can use it within our main model to associate and manage files of the indicated type. We must add the relationship to principal model ( in this case is User model ) and then we can use our new model.

    class User extends Authenticatable {  
       use Notifiable, HasFiles;
       
    	public function words() {  
    	   return $this->morphMany(Docs::class, 'filesable');  
    	}
    }
As you can see the relationship between the model and our FileManager class is morphological. 
Now we can use this relation for get all files with *word* types and you can use all methods for Laravel`s relationship. 

    $user->words; //return a collection of Docs
    $user->words()->find(2); 
This is a good idea if you want attach a kind of file with others tables of the database or apply any functions that you want.

### Files to zip
Is possible add many files to zip to save or download. Create a zip file this return a ZipFileManager:

    $user1 = User::find(1);  
    $zip = $user1->images->toZipFile();  
    $zip->save();  

In this case all images of User1 will be added to zip file and after this file will be saved in the disk and folder that have the model. This method save the file with extension `.zip`. Method **save** accept three parameters: 
|Parameter| Description | Default |
|--|--|--|
| name | The name of file without extension. (*optional*)|random string
| group | The group to which the file belongs.  | void
| description |  A description for a file (*optional*)|void 

    $zip->save('myImages', 'forDownloads','All my images');  
 
 The method save return a instance of FileManager of the file saved. 
 To change the disk and folder when you want save the zip file you must r call to method **disk** and **folder** of ZipFileManager.

    $zip->disk('s3')->folder("path/to/folder")->save();

Also, to ZipFileManager you can add other files of the first model or the others models what you want. You need use the method **addFiles**, and this method accept a collection of FileManager.

    $user2 = User::find(2);  
    $files = $user2->images;  
    $zip->addFiles($files);
Now we have in the zip file the images of User1 and User2 and if we use the method save this zip file will be associated with User1 because it is the one that created the zip. To change the user to which we want to associate the created zip file we will use the method **model**.

    $zip->model($user2)->save();//saved in the folder and disk of User2  
    $zip->model($user2)->disk('s3')->folder("path/to/folder")->save();
    $zip->disk('s3')->folder("path/to/folder")->model($user2)->save();
Keep in mind that when the model changes, the file will be saved in its default folder and disk, but if we modify before or after the folder or disk where we want to save the created zip file, this folder and disk will prevail over those indicated in the default model. 

For download the zip file we can use the method **download**. This method accept two parameters:
|Parameter| Description | Default |
|--|--|--|
| name | The name of file for download without extension. (*optional*)|random string
| deleteFile| For delete the temporal file after download. This is useful to prevent the system memory from becoming saturated  (*optional*)| true

    return $zip->download('myImages');//this will delete the file
    return $zip->download('myImages',false);//this will not delete the file

## FileManager class
FileManager class is the model that manage all data from a file. You can create your custom FileManager class for a kind of file in [Create a model for a kind of file](#create-a-model-for-a-kind-of-file).

### Options
|| Description | 
|--|--|
| name | The full name of file. 
| group | The group to which the file belongs  
| description | The description of file
| folder | The folder where the file is hosted 
| url |The combination of folder and name
| type | The type of file is configured in `config/filemanager.php`
| mime_type | The mime_type of file
| file_name | Only the name without extension
| file_extension | Only the real extension of file
| size | The size of file in bytes
| public | Is a file public or not
| disk | The disk where the file is hosted
| driver | The type of LaravelÂ´s driver which was used to save the file
| created_at | Date of creation of file
| updated_at | Date of update of file

### Methods
#### Create
To create a new FileManager see the documentation [Add a file](#add-a-file).

    $user = User::find(1); 
    $file = $user->addFile( $request->file('file'));
When we attach file to model, this return a instance of FileManager. If we ever need to access the content of a file we can do it with the attribute **getContent**. this return the binary code of file.

    $file->getContent;
#### Show image files on html
For image files FileManager provide a special attributes for get the src of image. The attribute *src* return the route for public files and the attribute *forceSrc* return the route for private an public files.

    <img src="{{$file->src}}"  width="100"/>
    <img src="{{$file->forceSrc}}"  width="100"/>
    

 - The route for public files is generated automatically by Laravel. 
 - For private local files the route by default is `private/file/`, if
   you want to change this route see the documentation [Private disk
   ](#private-disk)
  - For private files for amazon this attribute return
   a temporary url. 
  - For privates files from other drivers like ftp or
   dropbox return the url in the configuration of disk.

> Remember that in the file `config/filesystems.php` in the options of the
> disks you must indicate always the url options.

#### Copy
The method **copy** will make a copy of the same file with same name. It will be saved in the same folder and disk as the original file. This method accepts three parameters.
|Parameter| Description | Default |
|--|--|--|
| folder | The folder to save(*optional*)|null
| disk| The disk to use  (*optional*)| null
| modelo| The model to attach the new file (*optional*)| null
    $file2 = $file->copy();
    $file2 = $file->copy("/copies", 'public', $user2);
If the file exists in the folder and disk specified, FileManager will change the name to prevent overwrite.

#### Download
To download a file use the method **download**. This method accept a one parameter for choose the name for download the file, by default is her name. The name no need to provide an extension.

    return $file->download();
    return $file->download('name-of-file');
For download file in html FileManager provide an attribute and route for download the file. By default the route is `download/file/{has}`, and FileManager puts it into configuration automatically.  For public files we use the attribute *downloadSrc*, but if we want to download public and private files we will use *forceDownloadSrc*

    <a href="{{$file->downloadSrc}}">descarga</a> //only for public files
    <a href="{{$file->forceDownloadSrc}}">descarga</a> //for all files
if we want to change the default download path we must add this code in our Laravel route files:

    Route::get('you/route/{has}', function ($has) {  
       return \Redirect::route('download.file', $has);  
    })->name('youNameOfRoute');
You can modify the name and path of the route. After this, we must change the config. In file `config/filemanager.php` in *symbolic_link_download_files* change the default value by the name of you route.

    "symbolic_link_download_files" => "youNameOfRoute"

#### Delete
To delete a file only need use the method **delete** of model. This method delete file of data base and from host.

    $file->delete();
